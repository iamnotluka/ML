# ML
Machine Learning algorithm practice. Best way to learn is by actualy implementing these bad boys. AI will take over the world, might as well understand what is happening.

## Algorithms
List of algorithms I want to implement:
- Machine Learning:
  - Unsupervised:
    - K-Means, K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means
    - Hierarchical
    - Gaussian Mixture
    - Hidden Markov Model
  - Supervised:
    - Classification:
      - Support Vector Machines
      - Discriminant Analysis
      - Naive Bayes
      - Nearest Neighbors
      - NNs
    - Regression
      - Linear, GLM
      - SVR, GPR
      - Ensemble Method
      - Decision Tree
      - NNs
